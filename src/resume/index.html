        <h4>Bachelor thesis at PwC: Outlier detection within graphs by use of force-directed drawing</h4>
        <span class="page-description body-font gray mt1 regular">01/2016 – 04/2016</span>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I wrote my bachelor thesis at PwC in Frankfurt in the department Forensic Services; Data Analytics. With the approach I developed it is possible to find anomalies in visualized graph data. I built an interactive Java progam which had two different jobs. First: creating a layout of the graph data with a force-directed drawing algorithm and displaying the process and the finished layout within the application. Second: the discovery of possible outliers on basis of the previously created layout with a density based outlier detection algorithm. Furthermore, the application allows to navigate and explore the created graph layout, i.e. zoom, pan, rotate.
