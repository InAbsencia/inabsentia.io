        <h4>Bachelor thesis at PwC: Outlier detection within graphs by use of force-directed drawing</h4>
        <span class="page-description body-font gray mt1 regular">01/2016 – 04/2016</span>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I wrote my bachelor thesis at PwC in Frankfurt in the department Forensic Services; Data Analytics. With the approach I developed it is possible to find anomalies in visualized graph data. I built an interactive Java progam which had two different jobs. First: creating a layout of the graph data with a force-directed drawing algorithm and displaying the process and the finished layout within the application. Second: the discovery of possible outliers on basis of the previously created layout with a density based outlier detection algorithm. Furthermore, the application allows to navigate and explore the created graph layout, i.e. zoom, pan, rotate.

        <span class="page-description body-font gray mt1 regular">09/2012 – 04/2016</span>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Once I discovered the course of studies Media and Computer Science at RheinMain University of Applied Sciences I knew that‘s what I wanted to do. We did a lot: not only C, C#, HTML, CSS but also Java and Python; Projects in small groups or in a big Scrum team with 10 people; modules like Artificial Intelligence, Relational Databases, Computer Networks Programming, Computer Graphics. All this was not only theoretically but also needed in projects or weekly tasks. After I did my internship at PwC in Frankfurt in the department Forensic Services; Data Analytics, I also wrote my bachelor thesis with them and graduated in April 2016.

            Celestial Outbreak is a open source Breakout-like, planet inspired video game, implemented in core Java with little to no use of third party libraries. Includes fully customizable levels and game configuration. The main purpose of this project was to create a stand-alone game with simple controls together with a great user experience, using core Java only.

            Designed and created an Android application with the sole purpose of playing the hangman game. Implemented in Kotlin with use of third party libraries. The project was started in the course User Experience and Mobile Application Development and evolved further into a more in-depth side project. The main focus of the application is usability, user experience and mobile design.
