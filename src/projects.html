<h2>iyyel.io</h2>
The website you're currently on. Used as a blog and portfolio, a place where I can get out my thoughts.
Powered by Jekyll this site runs entirely for free (minus a yearly domain cost and server) and scores a
perfect performance score in all speed tests.

<h2>Celestial Outbreak</h2>
My first open source and independent project. It's a Breakout-like game, inspired by planets with a focus on
game and user customization, written in Java. Started in 2015 and steadily going further.

<h2>SuperHangman</h2>
SuperHangman is hangman for your Android phone. Starting out as a school assignment, SuperHangman has
turned into a full-fledged Android application with a lot of development ahead of it.
