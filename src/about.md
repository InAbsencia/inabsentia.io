<p>I'm Daniel Larsen, also known as "Iyyel".</p>

<p>I started using computers at a very young age and I was
fascinated by what they could do. This was the start of
my life long passion for technology. Since high school,
I've spent most of my spare time studying and learning
about programming and computer science concepts. Currently,
I'm enrolled in Master's degree in <a class="link" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/msc/programmes/computer_science_and_engineering">Computer Science</a>
with focus on <a class="link" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/msc/programmes/computer_science_and_engineering#study-programme__study-lines__embedded-and-distributed-systems">Embedded and Distributed Systems</a>,
at the <a class="link" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark, DTU</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a passionate software engineer who is always keen to 
learn new technologies. My interests include 
fuctional programming, algorithms and data structures, embedded and distributed systems, 
performance and software architecture.</p>

<p>I've grown a passion for functional programming and the mindset behind it,
which I am trying to use in my everyday work. I believe the commercial usage of 
functional programming will increase in the future. It is important for me to
find elegant, secure and scalable software solutions, to solve 
problems with structured reasoning and in-depth knowledge.</p>
