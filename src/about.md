<h5>Currently studying Software Engineering at the <a href="http://dtu.dk">Technical University of Denmark, DTU.</a>
Software engineer and *nix enthusiast. Fan of everything about technology.</h5>

Most people know me as "InAbsentia" in the nix and software communities. I've been using open-source unix based operating systems since 2015 after getting
extremely frustrated with the locked down nature of Microsoft's Windows platform. Ever since then I've become an open-source and freedom advocate.

I started using computers at a very young age and I was fascinated by what they could do. This started a life long passion in computer science and software engineering.
Since high school, I spent most of my spare time studying and learning about computer science and engineering concepts, which naturally led to a huge interest in 
mathematics and physics. My interest include, but not limited to embedding programming, artificial intelligence, algorithms, security, Linux, FOSS and much more.

Since I love tinkering with unix-like operating systems, I have started doing something the community calls "ricing".

> "Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the
practice of customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they actually were - which was also known as "ricing".
The word is accepted by the majority of the community and is used sparingly to refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.

Below is an example of one of my ricing projects.

If you have any questions regarding software engineering or unix, feel free to contact me trhough any of the avenues on the [contact](http://inabsentia.io/contact) page.

Have fun :)
