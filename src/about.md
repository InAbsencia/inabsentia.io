I'm Daniel Larsen, also known as "Iyyel".

I started using computers at a very young age and I was
fascinated by what they could do. This was the start of
my life long passion for technology. Since high school,
I've spent most of my spare time studying and learning
about programming and computer science concepts. Currently,
I'm enrolled in a Master's degree in <a class="link" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/msc/programmes/computer_science_and_engineering">Computer Science</a>
with focus on <a class="link" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/msc/programmes/computer_science_and_engineering#study-programme__study-lines__embedded-and-distributed-systems">Embedded and Distributed Systems</a>,
at the <a class="link" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark, DTU</a>.

I'm a passionate software engineer who is always keen to 
learn new technologies. I've grown a passion for functional programming,
which I am trying to develop actively. My interests include fuctional programming,
algorithms and data structures, embedded and distributed systems, software architecture
and performance. It is important for me to find elegant, secure and scalable software solutions, to solve 
problems with structured reasoning and in-depth knowledge.

If you have questions or just wanna say hello, please don't hesitate to contact me.
