Most people know me as "InAbsentia" in the *nix and software communities. I've been using open-source *nix based operating systems since 2015 after getting
extremely frustrated with the locked down nature of Microsoft's Windows platform. Ever since then I've become an open-source and freedom advocate.

I started using computers at a very young age and I was fascinated by what they could do. This started a life long passion in computer science and software engineering.
Since high school, I spent most of my spare time studying and learning about computer science and engineering concepts, which naturally led to a huge interest in 
mathematics and physics. My interests include, but are not limited to programming languages, artificial intelligence, algorithms, security, Linux, FOSS and much more.

Since I have a passion for tinkering with *nix operating systems, I have started doing something the *nix community call "ricing".

> "Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the
practice of customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they actually were - which was also known as "ricing".
The word is accepted by the majority of the community and is used sparingly to refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.

I'll be showcasing some of my own ricing on the blog whenever I get started with a new theme.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me through any of the avenues on the [contact](https://inabsentia.io/contact) page.

Have fun! :)
