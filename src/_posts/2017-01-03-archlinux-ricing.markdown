I have always wanted to make a post regarding Linux and ricing in general, so I thought it would be a nice way to start the year with my first blog post being about just that!
I have been using Arch Linux for roughly about a year now, before I had been using Ubuntu on and off for about a year as well, so I was and am still not a great Linux wizard, 
but I must say that Arch and Linux in general serves me extremely well both as a development and general environment.

So why did I choose Arch Linux as my daily distribution? Well there's a few very specific reasons for that.

>
- Rolling release.
- Bleeding edge software.
- AUR.
- Barebones.
- Simplicity.
- Arch Wiki.

Arch Linux is a rolling release distribution, which in simple terms mean that you only ever have to install the operating system once. This is because that all updates
(yes, every single update) will be available to download and install by just one simple command. This makes it extremely simple to get the latest and newest updates from the
Arch Linux repositories in just a few seconds.

There exist other distributions that are rolling release as well, but the fact that Arch is a rolling release distribution in cooperation with its software being on the bleeding edge
of things makes for a great combination, which is one of my favorite things about Arch. This is especially great for people with newer laptops, since old versions of Linux and corresponding
software tend not to run very well on bleeding edge systems.

Another great thing about Arch Linux is the Arch User Repository. (for short, AUR.) It is a repository where regular Arch Linux users can maintain packages of their own or other software, that for some reasons
that is not in the core repositories. This makes it a lot easier for the community to get what they want, since it is very simple to put up an AUR package of your favorite software.

Arch is extremely barebones and simple, since Arch is built on top of the KISS principle. (Keep it simple, stupid) This means that Arch Linux comes with only the most essential software packages
for the operating system to run. Arch Linux is essentially a playground, when you've got it installed, you can install whatever window manager or desktop environment you want and make it exactly how you want it.
I believe that this makes Arch Linux a much more personal OS, since you are pretty much forced to built it up yourself.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Last but not least, documentation. The Arch Linux Wiki is probably one of the best, if not the best general Linux documentation you can find. There exist Arch Wiki pages about specific hardware and 
specific laptops as well, which have helped me personally with a lot of problems. It is also a great place to start if you are new to Arch Linux. It is recommended that new Arch users read the
official installation guide on the Arch Wiki instead of following other tutorials elsewhere. You can also find the answers to most of your Arch related problems there, so it is really a great place
to get familiar with.

So, what is ricing? Ricing is a term used when one is referring to the act of customizing a Linux distribution or making it look great in terms of icons, colours and themes etc. Using Linux, you are able to create essentially your own system.
You are the owner of the OS, and you can pretty much do anything to customize it and making it look great if you have root access. I really like this, since your system just wont look like every other default configuration of Gnome
or KDE or some other popular desktop environment, it makes your system feel way more personal, and best of all, act exactly the way you want it to.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Ricing requires a little bit of scripting and Linux knowledge since most of the time you will be putting different configuration files to various directories of your system, so if you are completely new to Linux, I would suggest that you should
learn about directories and basic shell commands before starting your journey into ricing your system. People slightly familiar with how Linux works and terminals/shells in general should have no to few problems trying to rice their system. 
An example of laptop can be seen below.

After you've gotten familiar with how ricing works, I would suggest that you use some kind of version control software to keep track of all your configuration files (or so called dotfiles.) This is a great idea, since if you need to reinstall
your system or if you want to try another Linux distribution, you won't to need start all over again with ricing your system. I would suggest using Git or similar to version control your dotfiles and perhaps look into GNU Stow for managing them.

Enjoy :)
