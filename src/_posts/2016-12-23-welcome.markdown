After a long time, I have finally found a website layout that I feel like is what I want. It took a long time for me to find
something like this, so I am very happy that it finally happened. This site will primarily be a one stop for information about me,
with links to my github where I hold all of my scripts and projects that I am working on, and you can find an anonoymized version
of my current resum√© as well. I'll be posting about a few different things whenever I find time to do so, mostly regarding software
and anything unix.

I hope you will find some of the content on this site interesting or helpful in one way or the other, or at least check out my github
for some cool scripts. Don't forget to subscribe to the feed if you want to be kept updated. :)
