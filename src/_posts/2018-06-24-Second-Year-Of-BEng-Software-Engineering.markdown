It was only a few days ago, that I walked out of my last exam, not actually realizing at the time that another year of school had went by.
It was a weird feeling, because the two semesters of my second year had been the absolutely most demanding in both terms of studying and projects and now, it's all done.

As with my first year, I'm going to share the experiences I've had in my 3rd and 4th semester, regarding what I liked and disliked, which courses I had taken and why, my favorites, etc. If this sounds interesting to you, do continue down below.

### 3rd semester
<hr>
Ah, the 3rd semester. I remember I was both very excited for and afraid of this semester. I was excited, because I was having a course in Android application development as well as Operating Systems, but afraid of the Statistics course (which I later grew to love, who would have guessed?). Here's a list of the courses I took on my 3rd semester.

- ▪ Introduction to Statistics
- ▪ Compiler Construction
- ▪ Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
- ▪ User experience and mobile application development
- ▪ Operating Systems

I'm not sure whether I have made this clear before or not, but my school uses 2 semesters for a whole school year, where a semester consists of 4, 5 ECTS courses and a single 10 ECTS course.
The first period of school is 13 weeks long where all courses are taught during the week. The second period is 3 weeks long, where a single course is taught, primarily consisting of group work. This is where the last 5 ECTS of the 10 ECTS point course go.

I won't be talking too much about the Compiler and OOAD courses, since they weren't that great in my opinion.
The Compiler course was taught in Java using ANTLR, which itself was fine, but I would have loved to see some assembly and generally a more low level
 approach for teaching compilers and interpreters, but maybe that's just me. 
I would lie if I told you that the OOAD course was anything but a joke, because that's pretty much what it was, in my humble honesty.
The only content of the course was agile development methods and diagramming, a little bit of project management thrown in there, and that's about it.
Now, this would have been totally fine if I hadn't already attended 2 courses following the same ideas in my first semester.
In my opinion, it's very difficult to teach agile development methods and practices in university, because you never know how your future employer will use them.
It is however, a good idea to get a fundamental understanding of their manifesto.

Anyway, enough about that. I really enjoyed the user experience and mobile application development course, not necessarily the user experience part (let's face it, I'm not really a designer by heart)
 but moreso the practical application development. This was my first time creating any type of mobile applications, so I'm really happy to feel comfortable in the environment now, at least for Android,
that is. Course assignments consisted of an application where the user could play <a href="">hangman</a>
