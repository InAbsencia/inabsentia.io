Welcome to my website. On this site I'll be writing about the challenges I face in the
tech-industry both as a student and as an engineer. It's also a great way for you to
learn a little bit about who I am.

## About the site

This site will primarily be a one stop for information about me, with links to my GitHub 
where I hold all of my scripts and projects that I am working on, my experience with various
technologies, etc. 
I'll be posting about a few different things whenever I find time to do so, mostly regarding
software and anything technology related.

I hope you will find some of the content on this site interesting or helpful in one way or another, or at least check out my GitHub
for some cool scripts and projects.
