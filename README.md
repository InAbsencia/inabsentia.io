# Introduction
[iyyel.io](https://iyyel.io) is a personal website used as a portfolio. I use it 
to showcase the projects that I have been involved in. 
If one would like to contact me, there are several options listed on the site as well.

When it comes to websites, I am all about simplicity and performance,
which is why I am a big fan of static websites. This site is built using the static generation tool
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which makes it easy to manage sites  with simple markdown and html files.
The site scores perfect performance results in almost all tests due to its static nature.


# Installing
First, install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by following the link.

Clone this repository (use the mirror if needed):

`git clone https://github.com/iyyel/iyyel.io`

Change into the directory:

`cd iyyel.io`

`gem install jekyll bundler`

Run the site locally:

`bundle exec jekyll build`

`bundle exec jekyll watch`

Visit the site on localhost:4000.


# How it works
In the most basic sense, you run a local server through Jekyll where you can modify your site to your liking.
When you are happy with your result, you can deploy it to your choice of hosting environment.
