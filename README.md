# Introduction

[iyyel.io](https://iyyel.io) is a personal website used as a blog and portfolio. I use it 
to blog about technology when I feel like it and to showcase the projects that I've been 
involved in. If one would like to contact me, there are several options 
listed on the site as well.

When it comes to websites, I am all about simplicity and performance,
which is why I am a big fan of static websites. This site is built using the static generation tool
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which makes it easy to manage blogs and simple markdown and html files
for the site. This site is based on [Sergio Kopplin](https://koppl.in/)'s Jekyll
theme called [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) so all credit goes to him for the base site.

# Installing

First, install Jekyll by following the guide for your operating system [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
Make sure that the `jekyll` and `bundler` gems are installed.

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/iyyel/iyyel.io`

Change into the directory:

`cd iyyel.io`

Install the necessary gems:

`bundle install`

Run the site locally:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Visit the site on localhost:4000.
