I'm Daniel Larsen, also known by the pseudonym "iyyel" in online communities.

On this site, you will find information about me, my personal projects and a blog
where I post about my interests.

- Functional programming
- Programming language design
- Compilers, interpreters
- Open Source software
- Linux

I am an advocate of functional programming as I strongly believe in the paradigm
and its benefits over, for example, object-oriented languages. I am also a believer 
in open source software, which is also one of the reasons I am running Linux as my
primary operating system. Additionally, I try to incorporate the KISS principle 
(Keep it simple stupid) in both my work and personal life.

If you have any questions, want to discuss a relevant topic or just wanna say hello, 
do not hesitate to contact me through my email.
