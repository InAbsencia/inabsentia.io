EventLink is a distributed event management platform created with modern technologies. The idea 
behind EventLink is for it to be the one and only application needed to browse and attend events
such as concerts, festivities, local gatherings and more. This is made possible by crawling or 
fetching event information from various sources, transforming the data and storing it in a database.

The system is able to synchronize with the users' calendar, such that the user is presented with
an overview of their upcoming agenda including the events they are to attend. Additionally,
synchronization with social media is supported such that events from those will be
displayed in the agenda as well. Other features include attending and favoring events,
viewing and adding friends, etc.
