Celestial Outbreak is a space-themed, Breakout-like sandbox 2D game written in Java.
It features the original Breakout experience in a colorful user interface. The game
was built with customization in mind, meaning the user is able to create their own levels 
specifying properties such as dimensions, size, speed, color and effects of the
blocks, paddle, ball and power ups.

The goal with this project was to create a 2D game in Java with little to no use of
third-party libraries, which has been accomplished. The game solely relies on the
Graphics2D Java library for rendering purposes. The game is built as a state-machine for 
interacting with menus. Other than that, most of the code is parsing the level and option files.
